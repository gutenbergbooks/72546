PUBLISHER’S NOTE.


This volume of Mr. Nast’s “Christmas Drawings” is the first collection
of his works which has been published. The pictures are well called
“Drawings for the Human Race,” because they appeal to the sympathy
of no particular religious denomination or political party, but to
the universal delight in the happiest of holidays, consecrated by
the loftiest associations and endeared by the tenderest domestic
traditions. Christmas is the holiday of all; but it is especially the
Children’s day. The grotesque and airy fancies of childhood which cling
about Santa Claus, as the good genius of Christmas, are reproduced upon
these pages, in delightfully imaginative reality by the sympathetic
touch of the artist, so that the book is an overflowing feast of true
Christmas cheer.

Mr. Nast’s hand, when dealing with current topics of the time, tips
the flashing shafts of wit with morality; with relentless humor puts
cunning pretence in the pillory; and exposes public wrong to the fatal
merriment which laughs it away. But the artist’s hand is never happier
than when, with the lambent light of the same humor, it irradiates the
play of domestic affection, and makes the home circle gay. It is the
bluff, honest Santa Claus of “The Night before Christmas;” the Santa
Claus of the reindeer and the sleigh, alighting on the snowy roof, and
descending the chimney with his wondrous pack of treasures; the Santa
Claus of unsuspecting childhood, and the Mother Goose of undoubting
infancy, to whom these pages introduce us. There is no child who cannot
understand them, no parent who cannot enjoy them. Mr. Nast is fairly
without a rival in this kind. His Santa Claus is old Father Christmas
himself, and his welcome will be as general and as hearty as that which
salutes the crammed and enchanted stocking on Christmas morning.

Transcriber’s Notes


Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a
predominant preference was found in the original book; otherwise they
were not changed.

Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced quotation
marks were remedied when the change was obvious, and otherwise left
unbalanced.

This book does not have page numbers.

Transcriber added sequence numbers to the entries in the Table of
Contents.

When illustrations did not have captions, Transcriber added them by
using part of the corresponding entry in the Table of Contents, or text
within the illustrations themselves.

Transcriber added words and phrases that were within some of the
illustrations to their captions, and enclosed them in parentheses to
indicate they were not parts of the original captions.

The first illustration is the cover.

The original book was autographed. A copy of that is included in this
eBook as the second illustration.
